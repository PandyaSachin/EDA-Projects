Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) :
      Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). EDA is the art of unveiling insights, patterns, and anomalies within datasets. It's the preliminary investigation that helps data scientists understand their data, ask the right questions, and lay the foundation for robust analyses. In this article, we'll embark on a journey into the world of EDA, exploring its importance, techniques, and practical applications.
      EDA is akin to an archaeological expedition where data scientists unearth hidden treasures within raw data. It involves scrutinizing data's characteristics, distributions, and relationships through visualizations and summary statistics. By doing so, analysts can form hypotheses, refine research objectives, and identify potential pitfalls.

Key Goals of the EDA :
       1) Data Familiarization: EDA begins with data collection and cleaning. By understanding the structure and nature of the data, analysts can address missing values, outliers, and anomalies.
       2) Pattern Recognition: Visualization tools such as histograms, scatter plots, and box plots help uncover patterns, trends, and correlations that inform subsequent analyses.
       3) Hypothesis Generation: EDA encourages the formulation of hypotheses to explore relationships between variables. This guides further investigation and model creation.
       4) Data Quality Assurance: EDA allows the identification of data inconsistencies, inaccuracies, and biases, leading to higher data quality and more reliable insights.
